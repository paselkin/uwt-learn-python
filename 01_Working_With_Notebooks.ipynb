    "Lesson 01: Working with Notebooks\n",
    "=================================\n",
    "Python is a language - a way of giving a computer instructions. Instructions (which we call _commands_) are sent to an _interpreter_, a program that translates the commands into _machine code_, the more elemental instructions that are used directly by your computer. There are three main ways to give commands to the Python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The interactive Python command line (the \"_console_\"), where you type individual commands that get fed to the interpreter. Output goes to the console window or, in the case of graphics, sometimes to pop-up windows.\n",
    "2. _Scripts_ - files with multiple lines of commands (\"code\") that go to the interpreter in sequence. Output often gets saved as files, though it could also be sent to pop-up windows or the console window.\n",
    "3. _Notebooks_ like this one, which are a mix of blocks of code, blocks of text, and the text and graphics output from the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because notebooks can combine code, text, and the output from code in a single, interactive page, and because you can modify part of a notebook and quickly see the effects of that modification, notebooks have become a fundamental part of the move toward [reproducible science](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/10/3/405/293660). We will be using notebooks here, though, because being able to change code and see its effect immediately is valuable for teaching and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will be using notebooks and data that you will access through a _version control system_ called [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). In this system, all of the files we'll be using for the workshop are collected on a central bank of computers (a server) at [Github](https://github.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of This Notebook\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you have Anaconda Python, Git, and other relevant software installed \n",
    "2. Identify the location where notebooks are stored on your computer\n",
    "3. Update the notebooks on your computer for this course\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to install [Anaconda Python](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Follow the directions under your computer's operating system to install the Individual Edition. Don't install `miniconda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to install [Git from SCM](https://git-scm.com/), [Git from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git) or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a Windows PC, you'll need to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating the notebooks on your computer\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the tutorials in this workshop, you will need to synchronize the notebooks on your personal computer with those on our central server. We will do this using the command line and the `git` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by opening a command line window (either the **Terminal** on a Mac or **Powershell Prompt** on a Windows PC). If you are using a PC, the **Powershell** uses the old-school MS DOS interface. The Mac **Terminal** interprets what you type in the _Bourne Again (Linux) Shell_, or *`bash`*. To get to the *`bash`* shell on a Windows PC, you'll need to type \n",
    "```dos\n",
    "C:\\> bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: the \"**`C:\\>`**\" is the _DOS prompt_: don't type it!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then need to find and navigate to the folder where you want to store the materials for this workshop. On the lines below, the \"**`%`**\" refers to the _command prompt_, the symbols that the computer puts at the beginning of each command line to tell you that it's waiting for your input. Your command prompt may look different. **Don't type the % sign!** The text after the command prompt is what you should type; _italic type_ should be filled in with something appropriate for your computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably used to navigating around your computer's file system graphically, either using the Mac's **Finder** or the Windows **File Explorer**. You are no doubt familiar with the idea that your computer's hard drive storage is organized into folders (also called _directories_) that can contain files or other folders. If you are viewing the contents of a particular folder in the **File Explorer** or **Finder**, we often say that \"you are in\" that folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what folder you are \"in\" at the command line, try typing the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will print the name of the folder using the particular conventions of your computer's operating system. Mine says `C:\\Users\\Peter`. Then try typing:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will list the contents of the current folder. To move \"up\" by one folder and see its contents, try:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd ..\n",
    "% ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the list of files and folders, you should see the name of the folder you were originally in. Suppose that the listing contained a folder called \"Public\" that I wanted to look into. I'd type:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd Public\n",
    "% ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "If I wanted to get back to my original folder, I'd type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd C:\\Users\\Peter\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could also type:\n",
    "If I wanted to get back to my original folder, I'd type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "You'll need to be able to create folders to organize your files. To create a folder called _test_, type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% mkdir test\n",
    "```\n",
    "To delete the folder _test_, type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% rmdir test\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be careful with rmdir! It shouldn't delete folders without asking you, but just in case, use it with caution. There may not be an \"undo\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "To return to your home folder, type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now try this:\n",
    "1. Navigate to the folder where your installation of Anaconda stores its projects. Mine is `C:\\Users\\Peter\\AnacondaProjects`. \n",
    "2. List the contents of that folder.\n",
    "3. What happens when you type `ls -la` instead of just `ls` to list the folder's contents?\n",
    "4. Make a folder called `2018_python_workshop`, go into it, and verify that it is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are in the `2018_python_workshop` folder. In the rest of this section, you will set up the `git` version control system so that you can sync and work with the latest set of workbooks on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, start git using the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a hidden file to keep track of your changes in the shared files we'll be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then set your username to the username you created on Github:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git config user.name \"myname\"\n",
    "% git config user.email \"my@email.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "...where _`myname`_ and _`my@email.com`_are typically the username and email address you used to sign in on Github (I don't think it matters - it's just for record-keeping purposes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll need to make sure that `git` isn't going to overwrite what's on the main server when you make changes. Don't worry much about that possibility: `git` is pretty safe in this respect. But it's good practice to work on your own _branch_ of a project - your personal copy, basically - and have whoever is organizing the project merge the changes. This is a bit like using \"track changes\" in Microsoft Word. To start your own branch called _mybranch_ , type the following (but replace `mybranch` with your username):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git checkout -b mybranch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're ready to go. To download the full, current set of notebooks and data to your computer, type the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git clone https://github.com/paselkin/uwt-learn-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a folder called `uwt-learn-python`. Go into the folder and see what's there using the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd uwt-learn-python\n",
    "% ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that all of the files are up to date:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "A useful [cheat sheet of Git commands](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) is available from Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now try this:\n",
    "1. What files are in your `2018_python_workshop` folder now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting Jupyter\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "At this point, you should have a set of notebooks downloaded to your computer. You will need to switch from viewing those notebooks on the central server to _using_ the notebooks on your computer. Using your command line tool (**Terminal** or **Powershell**), navigate to `2018_python_workshop` folder and type `jupyter notebook` at the command prompt; press enter. A browser tab will open with a list of the notebooks in the `2018_python_workshop` folder. Click on `01_Working_With_Notebooks.ipynb` to open this notebook, which you can now edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future tutorials, you'll be using this same process to access the teaching materials:\n",
    "1. Open a command line window (**Terminal** or **Powershell**)\n",
    "2. Navigate to `2018_python_workshop\\uwt-learn-python`\n",
    "3. Sync the notebooks with the ones on the server by typing `git pull origin master`\n",
    "4. Open Jupyter notebooks in your browser by typing `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "5. Find the notebook you need to use\n",
    "\n",
    "What version of Python do I have?\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the Anaconda Python distribution for this class. That's a bit like saying \"we will be using Skippy brand peanut butter for this sandwich.\" Anaconda is one _distribution_ of the Python interpreter (and the rest of the language) among many. When you installed Python, you were able to choose which version to install. We will be using Python 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check what version of Python you have, run the commands in the code block below by clicking on the code and clicking the \"Run cell\" button at the top of the notebook (it looks like a \"play\" button on a CD player); alternatively, click the block and type  CTRL+ENTER (Windows) or CMD+ENTER (Mac). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now Try This\n",
    "1. Click the code again, and then the **Insert** menu. Choose \"Insert Cell Below\". You have just added space to insert your own code or text.\n",
    "2. Click the new space that you just opened, and at the top of the notebook window, click the word \"Code\". Choose \"Markdown\" from the dropdown menu. Type \"## This is a Markdown heading\", and press the Run Cell button. What happens?\n",
    "3. To learn more about writing text in Markdown, look at the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).\n",
    "4. Write a message saying that you have finished this tutorial. Click the disk icon at the top of the notebook, or click the **File** menu and choose \"Save and Checkpoint\". In the command window, type the following (note: _mybranch_ is whatever name you chose for your branch, above):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% git add 01_Working_With_Notebooks.ipynb\n",
    "% git commit -m \"Finished Working With Notebooks activity, added text.\"\n",
    "% git push origin mybranch\n",
    "```\n",
    "Congratulations. You have just modified a workbook and uploaded your version to GitHub."
